      <p className="About-me-paragraph">
        I am a creative Full Stack Software Engineer eager to get new challenges
        and learn new things ! If you are currently seeking a self-motivated and
        detail-oriented Web Developer, with the capacity to learn in a
        fast-paced environment and adapt quickly to different points of view,
        that's precisely what I'm prepared to bring to the table.
      </p>
      <p className="About-me-paragraph">
        I already have 10 years of experience in the professional world, working
        as a Cinematography Researcher before I discovered my passion for
        coding. I have been surrendered by Engineers friends all my life and It
        took me a pandemic to try to code and realize I did not have a thing
        only for the people, but also for the job.
      </p>
      <p className="About-me-paragraph">
        I have worked on web projects end-to-end in both the Back-end and the
        Front-end. After working in a different industry with hard deadlines and
        tight schedules, I am now fully dedicated to software development and I
        am looking forward to continuing to perfect my skills as I complete
        great projects. I enjoy interacting with different teams and putting
        myself in other people's shoes to maximize the user experience and
        implementation of the designerâ€™s ideas.
